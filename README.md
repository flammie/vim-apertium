# vim-apertium

Vim plugin for various apertium stuff. So far just autoload patterns, this is
due to many apertium xml files not having necessary parts to otherwise
automatically recognise xml, e.g. the XML processing instruction. See also
[vim-finitestatemorphology](//github.com/flammie/vim-finitestatemorphology).
